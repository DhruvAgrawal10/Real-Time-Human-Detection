#Project Title: Real-Time Human Detection
Overview:
This project implements a real-time human detection system using a webcam feed, TensorFlow object detection models, and OpenCV for visualization. The system identifies and counts the number of people in the video stream by leveraging pre-trained object detection models such as SSD MobileNet V2 or EfficientDet Lite0

Key Features:
Real-time object detection from webcam input.
Uses pre-trained COCO dataset models (e.g., SSD MobileNet V2).
Accurately detects people regardless of orientation (front, side, or back).
Draws bounding boxes and labels with detection confidence.
Displays total number of people detected in each frame.

Use Cases:
Crowd monitoring in public areas.
Smart surveillance systems.
Attendance tracking in classrooms or offices.
